        <h1>Creating a research library to share insights</h1>
        <p>The goal of this work was for people across and outside our organization to easily learn about our users' needs. On this project, I was a User Researcher at the <a href="https://www.rnid.org.uk/">Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID)</a>.</p>
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>RNID is an over 100 year old organization with a new digital focus. This new focus helped us begin to do user research with the people the charity supports.<br><br>And as our user research practice has grown, more people outside and across the organisation were asking for access to our insights.<br><br>I had already created a research repository when I joined RNID, but through discovery research I learned that others found the repository overwhelming. This stopped some people from looking at past research.</p>
        <h3>Plan</h3>
        <p>Previous interviews highlighted why people find it difficult to look for research in our existing repository. After coming up with and visualising ways to solve the problem, I started to work with our developer to build a simpler frontend to the library.<br><br>We needed to know how information should be structured within the frontend so it was less overwhelming for people who search. I planned a study to learn which words people use to search for research data and how people categorize insights.</p>
        <h3>Collect</h3>
        <p>To learn how people search for research, I asked 10 people across product, design and engineering to read a transcript from a research interview and write down which terms they would use to search for the data. I analyzed the tags people used and consolidated them into a refined set.<br><br>After that, I ran a card sort using the refined set of tags, and asked people them to organise the tags into categories. </p>
        <h3>Make sense</h3>
        <p>My research showed how people look for and categorize data.<br><br>It found that people from similar disciplines tend to use the same words to describe similar topics, while people across disciplines categorized things into similar groups.<br><br>I used the user-generated tags and categories to help define a structure for the data that would make sense for the people searching for it.</p>
        <h3>Share</h3>
        <p>Doing research with people who will use the library helped define how it could be set up based on the way they search and look for things. I recommended a structure for each insight and user need and shared it with the team.<br><br>Then, I met with our developer to scope how he would create a working prototype.<br><br>I shared these next steps with our Associate Director for Digital and Design Lead and received approval to move forward with developing a prototype.</p>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>The research library is currently in Beta. I shared the library across the organization and it was added to our Intranet.<br><br>I also wrote about my experiences researching and building a library on <a href="https://medium.com/rnid/making-it-easy-to-learn-about-users-and-their-needs-6a7d505aed9b">Medium</a>, so that people across our industry can learn from this approach.<br><br>Finally, I defined success metrics so that over time, we could identify whether we solved the right problems in the right way.</p>

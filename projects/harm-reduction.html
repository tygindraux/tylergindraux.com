        <h1>Discovering the needs of people who inject drugs</h1>
        <p>The goal of this work was to help people who inject drugs access new equipment and information so they reduce their harm when injecting. On this project, I was a User Researcher at <a href="https://www.wearewithyou.org.uk/">With You</a>.</p>
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>With You offers support with alcohol, drugs and mental health. In response to Covid-19, most services moved online or over the phone. But the number of people visiting needle and syringe services had dropped by 50% since the start of Covid-19, and no one was offering remote services for people who inject.<br><br>I was asked to lead a discovery into the needs of people who inject drugs. This was a new focus for the Digital team, who had primarily learned about people who use alcohol or are in recovery.</p>
        <h3>Plan</h3>
        <p>I met staff who deliver services to learn how delivery had changed during Covid-19. I also met clinical experts to learn more about the range of people who inject. This helped me create a plan for who to recruit and how.<br><br>I used these engagements to write research objectives:
            <ul>
                <li>understand why people might use a needle and syringe service</li>
                <li>understand how users and services have adapted during Covid-19</li>
                <li>understand why it’s difficult to access help to reduce harm</li>
            </ul></p>
        <h3>Collect</h3>
        <p>I interviewed users, frontline workers, pharmacists and other experts. I did one-to-one interviews, so I could focus on key objectives while taking into account each individual’s specific needs and traumatic triggers.<br><br>Interviews took place on the phone, Whatsapp, or Google Meet. I organised phone credits and helped those who needed to borrow phones or computers. After interviews, I connected people with support workers or their own networks to reflect safely.</p>
        <h3>Make sense</h3>
        <p>I learned about denial, shame and worry and how much motivation it takes to get help, because people fear judgment or getting in trouble.</p>
        <div class="quote"><q>I’m embarrassed to go in for new needles. I’m scared to run into my key worker.</q></div>
        <p>When people did go to a needle exchange, usually from a friend's recommendation, they felt better because they knew what to expect. But those who hadn’t gotten help before were nervous and couldn’t find alternative options.</p>
        <h3>Share</h3>
        <p>I started by sharing findings with close collaborators, including designers, developers and a product manager. We came up with ideas for what to do next.<br><br>I also held a session with staff who work in services and received their feedback on the findings and next steps. Then, I created a presentation for senior stakeholders. I focused on connecting our recommendations to the research as well as the organization's strategy, in order to have our next steps approved.<br><br>And to share findings more widely, I created a simple and accessible document that was shared across the organization.</p>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>By showing that fear stops people from getting help, my research helped us focus on the most risky stage in the journey and design for an anxious and worried mindset.<br><br>We also realized our hypothesis that most people who inject don't have internet access was not true, so we started looking at both in-person and online services.<br><br>We changed how we describe services and added <a href="https://www.wearewithyou.org.uk/help-and-advice/safer-injecting/">a new section to the website</a>. Then we tested content and a <a href="https://www.wearewithyou.org.uk/needle-syringe-services/">needle and syringe service finder</a>. I contributed to my colleague's <a href="https://medium.com/we-are-with-you/creating-an-accessible-online-space-for-people-who-inject-drugs-975e74a5d61b">blog post</a> about this work.</p>

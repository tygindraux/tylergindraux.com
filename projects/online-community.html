                        The goal of this work was to help Deaf people and people with hearing loss and tinnitus find, connect and learn from each other online. I led research to understand how we might help people connect with one another through an online community platform, defining user needs and service blueprint based on concept testing.

                    <p class="section-text">
                        RNID supports deaf people and those with hearing loss and tinnitus by connecting them to expert information. Our latest strategy included a new focus on helping people connect with each other too. I was asked to lead a study to understand how we might help people connect with one another online. Noticing the number of stakeholders involved and the existing assumptions for how to solve the problem, I worked with our Design Lead to lead an exercise to identify and agree constraints.

                    <h2 class="section-title">Plan</h2>
                    <p class="section-text">Based on our unknowns and constraints, I proposed objectives:</p>
                    <ul class="section-text">
                        <li>understand how people currently connect with others online</li>
                        <li>understand the types of interactions people expect to have with others online</li>
                        <li>understand how people expect to be kept safe online</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="section-text">Because we had initial ideas, I worked with an interaction designer to visualise concepts to use in testing. The concepts were based on insights from various conversations and workshops with stakeholders.</p>

                <div class="project-section">
                    <h2 class="section-title">Collect</h2>
                    <p class="section-text">
                        Working closely with British Sign Language interpreters, I tested concepts with users, including, deaf people, those with hearing loss and tinnitus and people who support them. I chose concept testing because I saw the need to identify a focus. Even if we knew people wanted to connect with others, we didn't know how, with whom or what that might look like. The concepts were a stimulus to understand how people expect to interact and with whom.

                    <h2 class="section-title">Make sense</h2>
                    <p class="section-text">
                        I learned that people expect a community to welcome everyone, but need ways to interact more closely with those who are similar to them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-quote">"Although I'm familiar with BSL, I'm very slow. Someone using sign language would leave me confused. I would need a voiceover or captions."</p>
                    <p class="section-text">Their priority was sharing personal stories, so they know they're not alone and can help others solve problems, in a way that is accessible to them and to others.</p>

                        By mapping findings to our original matrix, I showed how I built on or challenged our initial assumptions through doing research. Running a workshop with close collaborators allowed me to discuss the findings and turn them into a useful set of user needs. Then, I worked with our Design Lead to develop a future state blueprint for the service. I presented insights, user needs, a service blueprint and next steps to key strategic stakeholders.

                    <p class="impact-text">
                        My research helped define the purpose of an online community and let us build a vision based on what users expect and need. By focusing on the riskiest unknowns that were within our control, I filled knowledge gaps early in the design process. This let us start to refine a focused concept, start testing interactions with users and resolving issues, and begin to define the service blueprint and supporting processes based on what we learned about users' needs.

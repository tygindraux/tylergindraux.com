        <h1>Deciding the purpose of an online community</h1>
        <p>The goal of this work was to help Deaf people and people with hearing loss and tinnitus find, connect and learn from each other online. On this project, I was a User Researcher at the <a href="https://www.rnid.org.uk/">Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID)</a>.</p>
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>RNID supports deaf people and those with hearing loss and tinnitus by connecting them to expert information. Our latest strategy included a new focus on helping people connect with each other too.<br><br>I was asked to lead a study to understand how we might help people connect with one another online. Noticing the number of stakeholders involved and the existing assumptions for how to solve the problem, I worked with our Design Lead to lead an exercise to identify and agree constraints.</p>
        <h3>Plan</h3>
        <p>Based on our unknowns and constraints, I proposed objectives:
            <ul>
                <li>understand how people currently connect with others online</li>
                <li>understand the types of interactions people expect to have with others online</li>
                <li>understand how people expect to be kept safe online</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Because we had initial ideas, I worked with an interaction designer to visualise concepts to use in testing. The concepts were based on insights from various conversations and workshops with stakeholders.</p>
        <h3>Collect</h3>
        <p>Working closely with British Sign Language interpreters, I tested concepts with users, including, deaf people, those with hearing loss and tinnitus and people who support them.<br><br>I chose concept testing because I saw the need to identify a focus. Even if we knew people wanted to connect with others, we didn’t know how, with whom or what that might look like. The concepts were a stimulus to understand how people expect to interact and with whom.</p>
        <h3>Make sense</h3>
        <p>I learned that people expect a community to welcome everyone, but need ways to interact more closely with those who are similar to them.</p>
        <div class="quote"><q>Although I'm familiar with BSL, I'm very slow. Someone using sign language would leave me confused. I would need a voiceover or captions.</q></div>
        <p>Their priority was sharing personal stories, so they know they’re not alone and can help others solve problems, in a way that is accessible to them and to others.</p>
        <h3>Share</h3>
        <p>By mapping findings to our original matrix, I showed how I built on or challenged our initial assumptions through doing research.<br><br>Running a workshop with close collaborators allowed me to discuss the findings and turn them into a useful set of user needs.<br><br>Then, I worked with our Design Lead to develop a future state blueprint for the service. I presented insights, user needs, a service blueprint and next steps to key strategic stakeholders.</p>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>My research helped define the purpose of an online community and let us build a vision based on what users expect and need.<br><br>By focusing on the riskiest unknowns that were within our control, I filled knowledge gaps early in the design process.<br><br>This let us start to refine a focused concept, start testing interactions with users and resolving issues, and begin to define the service blueprint and supporting processes based on what we learned about users' needs.</p>

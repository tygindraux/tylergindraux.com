        <h1>Making guidelines for how we do research</h1>
        <p>The goal of this work was for people across our organization understand why and how we do user research. On this project, I was a User Researcher at the <a href="https://www.rnid.org.uk/">Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID)</a>.</p>
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>RNID is an over 100 year old organization with a new digital focus. This new focus helped us begin to do user research with the people the charity supports.<br><br>As I grew our research practice and helped embed it across organizational strategies, we needed to do more research than ever before. So, I ran a discovery to understand how our practice needed to evolve or grow.<br><br>Among other insights, I learned that people across the organization were not sure what user research is or how we do it.</p>
        <h3>Plan</h3>
        <p>Having already run a discovery and learned from colleagues of different disciplines, I had identified gaps in RNID’s understanding of user research.<br><br>I recommended that I create a guide to help people:
            <ul>
                <li>understand what user research is and isn’t</li>
                <li>understand my shifting role as a user researcher</li>
                <li>feel supported to do user research themselvest</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <p>The project was approved by the Associate Director of Digital and Innovation.</p>
        <h3>Collect</h3>
        <p>I drafted a guide on Miro, using existing diagrams and content from previous presentations I had given, as well as new material based on discovery findings.<br><br>I shared the guide with various colleagues and made changes as I received anonymous and direct feedback.<br><br>Then, to test the guide in context, I asked two designers to use it, who I has been training to run research studies. Instead of coming to me with questions, they used the guide to help them plan and do research tasks.</p>
        <h3>Make sense</h3>
        <p>In particular, I worked closely with the designers who were testing the guide, to understand how they found it and what was missing.<br><br>To facilitate these reflections, I ran debrief sessions after each research engagement where I asked them to describe things that went well and areas they were less confident. I synthesised these at the end of the study.<br><br>At the end of the study, I also ran a formal retrospective, where we discussed what went well and what we would change, and annotated the guide.</p>
        <h3>Share</h3>
        <p>Through prototyping and testing, I created a 34-page, plain language guide: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sKAns9eamwqkRCQH4au6sYjxsgQ8F9yVa_4pFdJiAoo/edit?usp=sharing">Do user research at RNID</a>.<br><br>I shared the guide across the organization through Microsoft Teams, on the Intranet and by circulating to individual leaders.<br><br>Within the digital team, and people more closely connected to user research already, I presented the guide in a closed session with the team.<br><br>I continued to encourage people to share feedback directly or anonymously.</p>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>Learning about specific gaps in understanding and confidence, helped me build training materials that better meet people’s needs.<br><br>After the guide was shared widely across the organization, I received many messages or emails from different colleagues who were interested in my work.<br><br>Some people who were interested in working more closely together, others wanted to discuss how we could share the guide outside the charity, and a number of colleagues reached out because they wanted to start doing user research.</p>

            <h2>"When it comes to leadership, that's where Tyler shines the most"</h2>
            <p>Tyler's research skills are some of the most honed and effective I've come across in my 20+ years in tech. Whether it be conducting research, analyzing the data, or presenting to stakeholders of all technical skill levels, Tyler was incredibly professional, approachable, and results driven, all while remaining true to the overarching mission.<br><br>When it comes to leadership, I'd say that's where I noticed Tyler shining the most. She led a group of researchers and designers through user interviews, research initiatives, and anything else that was asked of her. She also routinely took the initiative to rally her team to support other internal projects and future ideas, going well above and beyond what had been asked of her.<br><br>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessejamespdx/">Jesse James</a>, Staff Engineer</p>

            <h2>"Tyler exemplifies the idea of 'hitting the ground running'"</h2>
            <p>People talk about other people. That’s normal. What I heard people say about Tyler though, now that was a surprise. “How is she so knowledgeable and contributing this much so early into her time on the project?” I heard this statement or its sentiment multiple times from several folks about Tyler as she joined the project and what we saw from the outset was true throughout the life of the project we worked together.<br><br>Tyler exemplifies the idea of “hitting the ground running” and is an individual who takes initiative & defaults to action. Additionally, she will (respectfully) challenge the team, the work, and the client. She aims to execute work optimally with the best possible results. On one occasion, when we’d exceeded our target for interviews, she proposed adjusting questions & stimuli (that she had drafted while we were still in the field) so that we could get more out of the time we had with the users. It allowed us to learn even more acutely from Veterans and tell more compelling stories to our clients.<br><br>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikeprusaitis/">Mike Prusaitis</a>, Associate Director of Program Management</p>

            <h2>"A great force behind our team’s learnings, successes, and visions"</h2>
            <p>Tyler is an incredible leader with a strong moral compass. After working with her for a few months, it became undeniable that she was a great force behind our team’s learnings, successes, and visions.<br><br>She is extremely thoughtful, empathetic, and detail-oriented. No matter the situation, she asks thought provoking questions that lead to a clear rationale, logical next steps, and increased motivation.<br><br>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofiakirkman/">Sofia Kirkman</a>, User Experience Designer</p><br>

            <h2>"Tyler went out her way to set me up for success"</h2>
            <p>I noticed Tyler's research integrity and amazing organization right away. As my team began working with Tyler's, I found a research partner who is easy to collaborate with and who offers a great perspective when giving feedback.<br><br>At one point we had back-to-back, related research studies. In the two week's between Tyler's last session and my first, Tyler went out her way to set me up for success.<br><br>- <a href="">Clayton Zook</a>, User Experience Researcher</p><br>

            <h2>“Unique set of leadership and hands-on research and design skills"</h2>
            <p>Tyler is an asset to any team she joins, bringing a unique set of leadership and hands-on user research and design skills.<br><br>She was able to identify and prioritize the best areas for her to be involved, whilst coaching and mentoring other colleagues to carry out research. She also played a pivotal role in communicating with senior and executive level stakeholders, helping to set the strategic direction for the charity's focus on user-centred design and delivery.<br><br>Tyler was a fantastic colleague but has also earned great respect across the industry for her commitment to working in the open. In my previous role in the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS</a>, we admired her work from afar, having learnt so much for our own practice from her blog posts.<br><br>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-norman-378aa387?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3B%2FOl%2FAWUDSK21OCwMG2rqag%3D%3D">Sarah Norman</a>, Delivery Manager</p><br>

            <h2>“Even in stressful situations, she gets it done with a smile"</h2>
            <p>Tyler is the perfect (and rare) mix of creative and analytical. She has a good eye for detail, but doesn’t get lost in it. She’s efficient and methodical, yet also flexible and can go with the flow.<br><br>Her work always exceeded expectations and she was able to scope work with the “less is more” mindset, which I really appreciated.<br><br>Most of all, Tyler is super calm and chill. Even in stressful situations and with tight deadlines looming, she managed to stay calm, level headed, and get the job done with a smile.<br><br>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-anderson-674b6251?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3B%2FOl%2FAWUDSK21OCwMG2rqag%3D%3D">Megan Anderson</a>, Senior Design Researcher</p><br>

            <p>I learnt so much from Tyler about user research, service design and people more generally. She has a way of making people feel comfortable and confident when working together or in interviews.<br><br>I really appreciated Tyler’s constant work of putting our community first in everything we did. I was always amazed by the thoroughness of her work, I loved learning from her process.<br><br>One thing I’ll always remember is being supported to conduct interviews by Tyler. Not all people will put in the work to allow others to learn from them but Tyler took us along with all her work and allowed us to get stuck in.<br><br>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fay-ryan-523431102?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recommendations_details%3BgTMKNvrmSNmjdGidRfXDBg%3D%3D">Fay Ryan</a>, Content Design Lead</p><br>

            <h2>“Incredibly values driven"</h2>

            <p>I worked with Tyler on a variety of projects and found her to be an excellent, empathetic and thoughtful user researcher. She was incredibly skilled at working with users during sessions, delving into actions to uncover the core user needs.<br><br>Tyler presented her findings back to the team in detailed and coherent ways, providing honest and user-based reflections that we could take forward into the design and delivery of our products and services.<br><br>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-neb?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recommendations_details%3BgTMKNvrmSNmjdGidRfXDBg%3D%3D">Simon Nebesnuick</a>, Product Manager</p><br>

            <h2>“Enabled the key messages to resonate with the right people"</h2>
            <p>Tyler spent time to really understand the audience at With You.

She organised and curated the project in an impeccable and professional way.<br><br>She worked with a small but mighty cross functional team and blended in immediately. Spending time to understand the stakeholders enabled her to give feedback that enabled the key messages to resonate with the right people. It was a pleasure working with Tyler.<br><br>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steph-keenan-aa5550150?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recommendations_details%3BgTMKNvrmSNmjdGidRfXDBg%3D%3D">Steph Keenan</a>, Product Owner</p><br>

            <p>At the <a href="https://www.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs</a>, I'm leading research to make it easier for Veterans to receive meaningful answers to their questions.<br><br>Before that, I led research related to identity and access management at the <a href="https://www.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs</a>, making it simpler and more secure for Veterans to sign in and access their benefits and healthcare.

            <h4><a href="https://www.rnid.org.uk">The Royal National Institute for Deaf People</a> (February 2021 - June 2022)</h4>
            <p>As the first permanent user researcher at the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, I focused on embedding user research practice across the organization and its strategies. Beyond proposing, prioritizing and doing research to support the design and delivery of all our products and services, I developed tools and processes to share insights across and outside the organisation and trained colleagues to lead research with confidence. I also learned how to do accessible research with deaf people who use British Sign Language.</p>

            <p>At With You, a drug, alcohol and mental health support charity, I planned and delivered regular user research activities to inform decisions about priorities, usability of tools and service offerings.

            <p>I led the service design and research for a client project to lower theft at automated tills in supermarkets. We shaped an approach where we could work closely with users and staff who deliver the service to focus on improving the customer experience and journeys throughout checkout in order to reduce frustration and common theft. Contextual inquiries and group workshops helped us gather data which we translated into concepts ready to test. I managed two interns as well as client relationships and delivery.</p>

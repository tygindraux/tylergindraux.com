                        Where I am in the world, the end of winter is approaching slowly. Which takes a mental fortitude I only claim on rare days. It's not a harsh winter, but complaining helps me get through a lot of rain and a bit of darkness.
                        <br><br>There are other things that help. Reminding myself that the rain's filling our previously empty dams. Going on walks, especially on the cold days. And more cups of tea than I'd like to admit.
                        <br><br>If there's anything I do love about winter it's this. Winter reminds you of how to take care of yourself.

                        <br><br>The Model of Care for Co-design urges practitioners of co-design to be explicit about how people care for one other during co-design. KA's accompanying deck of cards helps groups and individuals learn how to run safe and respectful engagements.

                    <p class="section-quote">"We see Care as an equitable, proactive and compassionate experience that must be accessible for all."</p>
                    <p class="section-text">
                        In 2019, I attended a talk by The Care Lab. They described how they design end of life care with people and their families. It was something that every single person in the room could relate to, either worrying about this for ourselves or for others we love. In this call to action, The Care Lab makes a compelling case for fixing our broken "Systems of Care."

                        <br><br>This project looked at how young people provide feedback to Children's Social Work services. Through engaging with young people from various care settings, they created the "Meaningful Conversations Framework" to guide high-quality, inclusive conversations with care experienced young folks.

                        <br><br>The Compassionate Design toolkit provides examples and stories of designing with people who have advanced dementia and the people who care for them. They illustrate various design outputs, some of which are probably less designed with and more designed for. I found their framing of compassionate design to be really interesting in a context that's close to home for me.

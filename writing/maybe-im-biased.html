        <h1>Maybe I'm biased</h1>
        <h4>November 26, 2020</h4>
    <br>
    <p>I’ve often heard bias described as a lens. Each of us walks around with our own lenses, our ways of seeing the world. Throughout this newsletter, we’ve thought about how things like power or attribution are inevitably weaved into participatory design processes, and bias is just the same.</p>
    <p>This week I’m jumping straight into the resources. If you feel like having a listen, try David Dylan Thomas’ podcast. If you’re someone who prefers lists, then Buster’s cheat sheet might be a better start.</p>

        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <!--top of resources-->
        <h3><a href="https://betterhumans.pub/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18?gi=a7c861c00035">Cognitive bias cheat sheet</a></h3>
        <p>Buster Bensen spent his paternity leave reviewing Wikipedia’s list of cognitive bias and re-working them into a list of 20 ‘biased mental strategies’ organized by the problem they’re trying to solve. He goes on to break it down into 4 easier to remember takeaways, helpful!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.mcad.edu/events/race-and-design">Race and Design with Liz Ogbu and Joseph Kunkel</a></h3>
        <div class="quote"><q>Though change is occurring slowly, racism is still deeply embedded in design practices and products.</q></div>
        <p>Racial bias is deeply embedded in society, which includes our design practices. In this discussion, we hear from Liz Ogbu and Joseph Kunkel engaging with racism and inequity in the design field.</p>
        <!--next resource-->
        <h3><a href="https://growth.design/psychology">101 Cognitive Biases & Principles</a></h3>
        <p>What’s nice about this is there a lots of examples, tips and checklists which you can translate into ways of improving user experience. Not exactly centred on participation, but a worthwhile way of thinking about bias.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cognitive-bias-podcast/id1197648130">The Cognitive Bias Podcast</a></h3>
        <p>David Dylan Thomas wrote <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/design-for-cognitive-bias">the book on design for cognitive bias</a>. If you’re a podcast fan, I’d suggest digging into this one where David explores biases and how they show up in the world of design.</p>

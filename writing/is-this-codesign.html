        <h1>Is this co-design?</h1>
        <h4>January 14, 2021</h4>
    <br>
    <p>This past week, I was in a meeting with many people across many disciplines. We came together to talk about research. And, without going into any specifics, we landed on the topic of “is this co-design or?”</p>
    <p>I’m sure quite a few of you have heard this question many, many times. As you can imagine, I hear it quite a lot writing this newsletter (and being a user researcher). Ironically, I’ve realized that my inclination is usually to say, “well, not quite.”</p>
    <p>As far as participation goes, co-design is <a href="https://www.citizenshandbook.org/arnsteinsladder.html">pretty far up the ladder</a>. To borrow from Kelly-Ann McKercher:</p>
    <div class="quote"><q>If you don’t have time to build relationships, you don’t have time for co-design.</q></div>
    <p>I so often come back to this idea, are we building relationships or are we including people for a moment in time. When I’m doing research, whether peer- or practitioner-led, I imagine we’re moving up the ladder, but are we close to the top?</p>
    <p>My point being, it’s a spectrum. And when we talk about participation, we use a lot of jargon (<a href="https://twitter.com/nanz_nair/status/1276752099775139842">as Nandini shows, in just 105 characters</a>). So, as we reconvene and we start a brand new year, I thought why not reflect on what we mean by the co-word.</p>

        <div class="quote"><q>Co-design is a partnership, more than it is a process.</q></div>
        <p>In this blog, Janet discusses co-design within the context of the Defra Future Farming programme. It’s useful to hear them discuss, in detail and with clarity, what a co-design approach looks like for this project. It sounds like, for them, it means including a lot of different actors in giving feedback and using that to inform decisions, designs and the future of farming.</p>

        <div class="quote"><q>If you set out to co-design, you must be willing to hear that people with lived experience do not need more products, programs or services, and they may not even need you.</q></div>
        <p>KA has a way of making co-design feel practical, necessary and achievable – but without comprising on integrity and relationships. If you feel like co-design is a catchy buzzword to throw in to win a bid, clear your schedule and check out their work.</p>

        <p>I started following Jo sometime last year. In this blog, she gives an overview of the history of co-design, it’s influences and how it’s been shaped over time. As <a href="https://writingprincess.medium.com/">Ovetta Sampson</a> points out in the comments, this summary requires expansion through a decolonized perspective. But, if you find yourself wondering the difference between participatory action research and human-centred design (etc.) this will likely help you pull all those pieces together.</p>

    <p>As Liz Sanders said:</p>
    <div class="quote"><q>Participatory experience is not simply a method or set of methodologies, it is a mindset and an attitude about people. It is the belief that all people have something to offer to the design process.</q></div>

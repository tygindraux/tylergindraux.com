                        As our user research practice grows, more people across and outside of the <a href="https://rnid.org.uk/">Royal National Institue for Deaf People (RNID)</a> ask about our findings. In this blog, I'll share how we've made it easier for people to learn about users and their needs.

                    <p class="section-title">How it used to work</p>
                    <p class="section-text">
                        I've maintained a user research repository (basically, a really big spreadsheet) since I started at RNID. It's where I store findings and includes things like, insights, observations and quotes.
                        <br><br>Let's say a content designer asked what we know about British Sign Language (BSL) translations. I'd search in the repository, find relevant information and share links to items in Airtable.
                        <br><br>So, why weren't other people looking in the repository?
                        <br><br>I noticed that people were still coming to me instead of looking in the repository. I started to ask why, and found that:
                        <br><br>some people couldn't access Airtable
                        <br>some people didn't know how to use Airtable
                        <br>some people couldn't find what they were looking for
                        <br>most people found the amount of information overwhelming
                        <br><br>There were a few exceptions. Those who found the repository helpful explained why and how they used it, which showed how we might make it easier for others to use too.

                    <p class="section-quote">"I search, 'assistive technology' or 'hearing aids' and I see if I can find something. Otherwise, I search by a type of user, for example, 'deaf person' or 'hearing loss.'"</p>

                    <p class="section-title">Building a simpler frontend</p>
                    <p class="section-text">
                        After learning about the problems with our current setup, I recommended creating a frontend, or a simple interface, for the repository. The frontend would:
                        <br><br>be open and easy to access (without a login)
                        <br>let people search for insights or user needs
                        <br>let people share a link to a specific finding
                        <br>let people find high-level information, not all the detail
                        <br><br>Our freelance developer, <a href="https://dogwonder.co.uk/">Rich</a>, started building a proof of concept. He suggested creating a static site, using a static site generator, which connects to the Airtable API and generates a website.

                    <p class="section-title">How we structured the library</p>
                    <p class="section-text">
                        While Rich worked out Airtable's API, we needed to learn how we should structure the library.
                        <br><br>I planned a two-part study to learn:
                        <br><br>which words people use when they search for research
                        <br>the relationship between different topics
                        <br><br>This would help us understand how to structure the library so it makes sense for the people using it.
                        <br><br>First, what do people search?
                        <br><br>To learn how people search for research, I asked colleagues to read one interview transcript and one insight and, using sticky notes, write down which word(s) they would use to search for that snippet of data.
                        <br><br>I found that people from the same discipline tend to use similar words to describe a topic, but this can differ across disciplines. I recommended updating tags to make them more descriptive or something that a user would say.
                        <br><br>Next, how do people categorise different tags?
                        <br><br>Using a sample of the tags we created, I ran a card sort where I asked colleagues to organise tags into categories.
                        <br><br>The card sort showed that most people, across different disciplines, put tags into similar groups and use similar names to describe them. I used these findings to recommend which fields we use to describe each user need and insight in the library.
                        <br><br>These exercises also helped us recommend a structure for the library overall. Alex, our Design Lead, mocked up how the library might work based on this.
                        <br><br>He proposed we have a single main page where people can search for both insights and needs through a basic text search, as opposed to having separate pages and searches for each.
                        <br><br>We shared recommendations with Rich who pulled it all together in a working prototype.

                    <p class="section-text">
                        We're launching a prototype of the library soon, which we'll share to gather live feedback.
                        <br><br>If we find that we're solving the right problem then we'll continue to increase awareness of the library and improve over time.

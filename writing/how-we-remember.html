        <h1>How we remember</h1>
        <h4>26 August 2022</h4>
        <br>
            <p>While I’m on a break from work, I open my computer a lot less – usually to do something mundane or overly meticulous, like, make a list, update a spreadsheet or organise photographs in my drive.</p>
            <p>One of my lists tallies how many days of the month that I’ve surfed. A kindred spreadsheet includes all the books I’ve read since 2017. And photographs in my Google Drive are organised by month.</p>
            <p>I’ve been drawn to this level of chronicling since I was young. I enjoy knowing that someday I can go back and relive a moment – finding a relevant playlist, photograph and my favourite book at that point in time.</p>
            <p>After recently finishing Sarah M. Broom’s <a href="https://books.google.com.mx/books/about/The_Yellow_House.html?id=Vm-DDwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y&source=kp_book_description&utm_campaign=Design%20With&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">The Yellow House</a>, where she chronicles her and her families’ histories and experiences of living in New Orleans East, I started to reflect on this act of archiving.</p>
            <p>Broom finds her experience, and that of her neighbourhood, unmentioned in New Orleans’ history books and news stories – an otherwise widely studied, celebrated and documented city. She writes to understand, to call out, to remember, and to archive.</p>
            <p>And while The Yellow House is Broom’s own account, she weaves in her mother’s, siblings’, aunt’s and uncle’s words, too.</p>
            <p>Archivist and activist, <a href="https://en.everybodywiki.com/Allison_Boucher_Krebs?utm_campaign=Design%20With&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Allison Boucher Krebs</a>, said:</p>
            <div class="quote"><q>An archive needs to be a yarning, a conversation, with all the tacit protocols involved in a conversation between people, the respect in engagement that allows a conversation to continue over time, to be returned to, to grow and deepen, within a shared creative space. Yarning implicitly acknowledges the various contributors, embraces their contributions. It is by nature co-creative.</q></div>
            <p>Archives tell stories. While some might tell the (monotonous) story of how many surfs I’ve had this month – told from a singular perspective, mine alone – others may weave together identities, accounts and understandings.</p>
            <p>I’ve stumbled upon various ‘community archives’ or ‘community memory archives,’ in my quest to understand my chronicles.</p>
            <p>And, in their focus on engaging individuals in a collective act of storytelling, it feels there may be something we, as people who design, may learn from them.</p>

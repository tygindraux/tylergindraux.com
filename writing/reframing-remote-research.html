        <h1>Reframing remote research</h1>
        <h4>August 27, 2020</h4>
        <br>
        <p>I started a new job last week, which has me returning to many of the resources I sifted through when the pandemic first hit. For those of us with experience conducting research or facilitating co-design activities in person, there are so many things that need to change given a remote-only context.</p>
        <p>However, it’s worth remembering that there are also a lot of things that remain the same and not all of these changes are negative.</p>
        <p>I’m particularly drawn to resources which highlight both the constraints and the possibilities of conducting remote research or co-designing online. It warms my generally optimistic heart when I see how researchers and designers are re-framing remote design work.</p>
        <p>Here are a few provocations I'm sitting with today:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How might we be able to provide a better experience for research participants in a remote setting?</li>
                <li>How do we design for different levels of digital literacy and can we hold space for a spectrum of engagement?</li>
                <li>How might we allow participants to co-author design projects, when we’re only coming together online?</li>
                <li>And finally, can we use this experience to envision more contextual and embedded research practices post-Covid?</li>
            </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <!--top of resources-->
        <h3><a href="https://stripe-partners.medium.com/designing-remote-ethnography-ba4f85f996ee">Embedded research and embracing remote</a></h3>
        <div class="quote"><q>Our philosophy is to embrace the new reality — rather than trying to conduct an ersatz of in-person research online, we welcome the new paradigm.</q></div>
        <p>I almost don’t want to write anything here, because I feel like it’s just definitely worth a read. This piece is very practical but also hopeful; I keep coming back to the notion that time and space constraints have been flipped on their heads, given a remote research context.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://blog.wearefuturegov.com/evolving-design-and-research-practice-through-the-pandemic-d5d253403892">Evolving design practice through the pandemic</a></h3>
        <div class="quote"><q>Holding the space for long term thinking when our partners are in a reactive mode trying to address emerging needs, can be challenging.</q></div>
        <p>Towards the beginning of the pandemic, FutureGov shared a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T0sjyDlvCRJG95q9LYmPiPaU8baLG7L2IQwRpNsfq2M/edit#slide=id.g9ff92d5271_3_170">slide deck</a> with practical ways to transition to remote design research. And more recently, Alessandra wrote this piece about how FutureGov’s service design team is developing new ways of working through a crisis.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://portable.com.au/events/remote-design-research-webinar">A webinar about co-designing remotely</a></h3>
        <div class="quote"><q>But what happens when the world as we know it shifts, and designers need to now support co-creation activities with a diverse range of humans online?</q></div>
        <p>This webinar, hosted by Portable, offers practical recommendations to co-designing remotely. The most useful bit, for me, is when Aishling goes through common research methods and describes ways of facilitating them online.</p>

    <h2>Thanks</h2>
        <p>As Cath Richardson and Cyril Maury said:</p>
        <div class="quote"><q>It's still important to acknowledge what's missing when we take away the experience of our bodies together in a place.</q></div>

        <h1>Imagining a better world</h1>
        <h4>December 17, 2020</h4>
    <br>
    <p>One of my favorite things about human beings is our ability to imagine new worlds. In some ways, I’ve <a href="/writing/a-glimpse-of-hope">talked about this before</a>. It’s that ability to see a new way of doing something that, quite literally, keeps us going.</p>
    <p>In January, Covid-19 was declared a global pandemic. We all know the repercussions this has had on the way we live, work, connect, travel and even vote.</p>
    <p>In May, the murder of George Floyd ignited worldwide protests against racial injustice, with many people evaluating their own roles in oppressive systems and particularly, the role of the police.</p>
    <p>It might be trivial to try and learn something from what has been a difficult, “unprecedented” and unpredictable time, but, if this year has taught me anything, it’s our collective ability to imagine new worlds.</p>
    <p>Over and over we’ve reflected on the way things are, closely comparing it to the way we wish they might be. We’ve used our imagination, and from that, we’ve gained hope.</p>
    <p>So, to end the year I leave you with this. An ode to the future, to our ability to imagine new ones, and the ways we already do this, together.</p>

        <p>In this talk, <a href="https://tristanschultz.com/">Tristan Schultz</a>, a interdisciplinary designer, strategist and a member of the decolonising design network explores the use of mapping to progress the decolonisation of design, answering questions while imagining new futures.</p>

        <p>As part of a series exploring New Zealand’s post-Covid design practice, in this piece we learn about the ways that tangata whenua are drawing upon their ancestral knowledge and adapting the learnings to move cultural issues forward in a modern context. It’s fascinating to think about the future through the context of the past…</p>

        <div class="quote"><q>We design the world and the world designs us back.</q></div>
        <p>I hope you’re looking forward to at least a couple of days off this December, which often for me looks like reading, reading and more reading. Arturo Escobar’s Designs for the Pluriverse feels a perfect way to end this year. In this book, Arturo explores design’s role in creating the many world crises we face now, and how we might imagine new worlds (plural) as we move forward.</p>
